# Retail-Data-Analysis

Retail Data Analysis Project

I recently worked on a retail data analysis project where I:
✅ Cleaned and transformed large datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency
 ✅ Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
 ✅ Identified key customer segments based on region, occupation, gender, and age, enabling better targeting strategies
This experience helped me strengthen my data analysis and storytelling skills with real-world insights.💡📊
